      <span id="one"><span id="span">W</span></span>elcome to the <span id="span">M</span>atrix, where l<span id="span">i</span>fe's a game,<br />
      And the rule<span id="span">s</span> are set by those with fame,<br />
      A world of conformity, <span id="span">a</span> place of routine,<br />
      Where the masses follow wi<span id="span">t</span>hout question or dream.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      A place where success is measu<span id="span">r</span>ed in wealth,<br />
      And the pursuit of happiness <span id="span">i</span>s traded for stealth,<br />
      Where education is a means to an end,<br />
      And the daily grind is what we must defend.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      But fear not, for there are those who see,<br />
      The Matrix for what it is, and what it could be,<br />
      We are the ones who think outside the box,<br />
      And challenge the norms with our own parado<span id="span">x</span>.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      We seek <span id="span">t</span>o break free from the Matrix's grasp,<br />
      And carve out a life t<span id="span">h</span>at's our own to clasp,<br />
      To live with purpose, to follow our heart,<br />
      And creat<span id="span">e</span> a future that sets us apart.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      The Matrix may be strong, but so are we,<br />
      With our own unique paths, and our own destiny,<br />
      So let us break free, and create our own way,<br />
      And live a life that we can truly say,<br />
      Is one of freedom, of j<span id="span">o</span>y, and of peace,<br />
      Where our passions and dreams are given <span id="span">r</span>elease.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      The Matrix is a rid<span id="span">d</span>le, waiting to be solved, <br />
      To escape its clutches, one must get involved, <br />
      Find your own path, let the story unfold. <br />
